	abstract = {Molecular profiling of proteins and phosphoproteins using a reverse phase protein array (RPPA) platform, with a panel of target-specific antibodies, enables the parallel, quantitative proteomic analysis of many biological samples in a microarray format. Hence, RPPA analysis can generate a high volume of multidimensional data that must be effectively interrogated and interpreted. A range of computational techniques for data mining can be applied to detect and explore data structure and to form functional predictions from large datasets. Here, two approaches for the computational analysis of RPPA data are detailed: the identification of similar patterns of protein expression by hierarchical cluster analysis and the modeling of protein interactions and signaling relationships by network analysis. The protocols use freely available, cross-platform software, are easy to implement, and do not require any programming expertise. Serving as data-driven starting points for further in-depth analysis, validation, and biological experimentation, these and related bioinformatic approaches can accelerate the functional interpretation of RPPA data.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a computational method for constructing networks based on reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data to identify complex patterns in protein signaling. The method is applied to phosphoproteomic profiles of basal expression and activation/phosphorylation of 76 key signaling proteins in three breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, LCC1, and LCC9). Temporal RPPA data are acquired at 48h, 96h, and 144h after knocking down four genes in separate experiments. These genes are selected from a previous study as important determinants for breast cancer survival. Interaction networks between the proteins and phosphorylated proteins are constructed by analyzing the expression levels of protein pairs using a multivariate analysis of variance model. A new scoring criterion is introduced to determine the proteins that changed significantly at each of the three time points. Signaling networks are constructed based on statistically significant protein pairs selected from the RPPA data. Through a topology based analysis, we search for wiring patterns to help identify key network nodes that are associated with protein expression changes in various experimental conditions.},

Cancer cell lines are major model systems for mechanistic investigation and drug development. However, protein expression data linked to high-quality DNA, RNA, and drug-screening data have not been available across a large number of cancer cell lines. Using reverse-phase protein arrays, we measured expression levels of ∼230 key cancer-related proteins in {\textgreater}650 independent cell lines, many of which have publically available genomic, transcriptomic, and drug-screening data. Our dataset recapitulates the effects of mutated pathways on protein expression observed in patient samples, and demonstrates that proteins and particularly phosphoproteins provide information for predicting drug sensitivity that is not available from the corresponding mRNAs. We also developed a user-friendly bioinformatic resource, MCLP, to help serve the biomedical research community.},

	abstract = {DNA microarrays are a new and promising biotechnology which allows the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously. The present paper describes statistical methods for the identification of differentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Although it is not the main focus of the paper, new methods for the important pre-processing steps of image analysis and normalization are proposed. Given suitably normalized data, the biological question of differential expression is restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each gene of the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and responses or covariates of interest. Differentially expressed genes are identified based on adjusted p-values for a multiple testing procedure which strongly controls the family-wise Type I error rate and takes into account the dependence structure between the gene expression levels. No specific parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the test statistics and a permutation procedure is used to estimate adjusted p-values. Several data displays are suggested for the visual identification of differentially expressed genes and of important features of these genes. The above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene expression in the livers of mice with very low HDL cholesterol levels. The genes identified using data from multiple slides are compared to those identified by recently published single-slide methods.},

	abstract = {Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology introduced a miniaturized “antigen-down” or “dot-blot” immunoassay suitable for quantifying the relative, semi-quantitative or quantitative (if a well-accepted reference standard exists) abundance of total protein levels and post-translational modifications across a variety of biological samples including cultured cells, tissues, and body fluids. The recent evolution of RPPA combined with more sophisticated sample handling, optical detection, quality control, and better quality affinity reagents provides exquisite sensitivity and high sample throughput at a reasonable cost per sample. This facilitates large-scale multiplex analysis of multiple post-translational markers across samples from in vitro, preclinical, or clinical samples. The technical power of RPPA is stimulating the application and widespread adoption of RPPA methods within academic, clinical, and industrial research laboratories., Advances in RPPA technology now offer scientists the opportunity to quantify protein analytes with high precision, sensitivity, throughput, and robustness. As a result, adopters of RPPA technology have recognized critical success factors for useful and maximum exploitation of RPPA technologies, including the following:
preservation and optimization of pre-analytical sample quality,application of validated high-affinity and specific antibody (or other protein affinity) detection reagents,dedicated informatics solutions to ensure accurate and robust quantification of protein analytes, andquality-assured procedures and data analysis workflows compatible with application within regulated clinical environments., In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the first three Global RPPA workshops were held in the United States, Europe, and Japan, respectively. These workshops provided an opportunity for RPPA laboratories, vendors, and users to share and discuss results, the latest technology platforms, best practices, and future challenges and opportunities. The outcomes of the workshops included a number of key opportunities to advance the RPPA field and provide added benefit to existing and future participants in the RPPA research community. The purpose of this report is to share and disseminate, as a community, current knowledge and future directions of the RPPA technology.},

	abstract = {Mastering the systematic analysis of tumor tissues on a large scale has long been a technical challenge for proteomics. In 2001, reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were added to the repertoire of existing immunoassays, which, for the first time, allowed  a profiling of minute amounts of tumor lysates even after microdissection. A characteristic feature of RPPA is its outstanding sample capacity permitting the analysis of thousands of samples in parallel as a routine task. Until today, the RPPA approach has matured to  a robust and highly sensitive high-throughput platform, which is ideally suited for biomarker discovery. Concomitant with technical advancements, new bioinformatic tools were developed for data normalization and data analysis as outlined in detail in this review. Furthermore, biomarker signatures obtained by different RPPA screens were compared with another or with that obtained by other proteomic formats, if possible. Options for overcoming the downside of RPPA, which is the need to steadily validate new antibody batches, will be discussed. Finally, a debate on using RPPA to advance personalized medicine will conclude this article.},
