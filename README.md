# RPPA
R functions I use for analysing RPPA data from the Zeptosens system.

I would like to eventually put these together in a R package to tidy up my analyses. Damjan Vukcevic's guide to writing R packages will be used to guide this. It can be found [here](http://damjan.vukcevic.net/2016/09/20/writing-and-managing-r-packages/).
